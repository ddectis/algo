This is an educational project I undertook to better understand common algorithms. The coursework for this material was in Python and then I rewrote the algorithms in JavaScript. I also added simple pages for each algorithm.

In tackling this project, I enjoyed learning about these classic algorithms. It quickly became clear why these patterns are so widely used. This project was also great practice using and understanding recursion.
